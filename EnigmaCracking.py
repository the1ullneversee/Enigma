    It seems they are stuck on one last code. It came in via email so we suspect it's just spam, probably related to a social media website, but you never know when you'll find a gem in that kind of stuff.
    The tutor has narrowed the search and found most of the settings, but it seems this code was made with a non-standard reflector. Indeed, there was a photo attached to the email along with the code.
    It appears that the sender has taken a standard reflector, cracked it open, and swapped some of the wires â€“ two pairs of wires have been modified, by the looks of the dodgy soldering job.
    To be clear, a single wire connects two letters, e.g. mapping A to Y and Y to A. The sender has taken two wires (fours pairs of letters), e.g. A-Y and H-J, and swapped one of the ends, so one option would be H-Y and A-J.
    They did this twice, so they modified eight letters total (they did not swap the same wire more than once).
