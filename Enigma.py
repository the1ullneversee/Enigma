"""
The battery supplies a current.
The operator presses the A key.
The current flows, 'sending' an A to the plugboard â€“ there is no lead connected to A, so this remains an A.
An A is sent to the rotors through the entry board.
At each rotor, the A is exchanged for another character: in this four-character simplification, at each rotor from right to left:
A becomes F
then F becomes D
then D becomes A
Now, the reflector maps back through the entire circuit again: A becomes F, and this is passed back through the rotors, from left to right:
F becomes S
S becomes A
and A becomes S
S is sent to the plugboard, which this time has a lead connected.
So S is exchanged for D through the lead.
Finally, the D bulb is lit up.
